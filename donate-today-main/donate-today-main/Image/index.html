                <p>
                    At least, 64 upazilas (subdistricts) of 10 districts in northern and southern Bangladesh, including Sunamganj and Sylhet, and the northeast, including Habiganj and Netrokona, northeast have reached an extreme level of flood danger.

                    At least, 25 people have been killed more than four million stranded in the floods, caused by incessant rains in the last week, with the Army, Coast Guard and the Navy evacuating people.

                <h1>They need us <br> to survive</h1>
                <p>
                    Each year, more deaths occur due to flooding than from any other thunderstorm-related hazard. 
                    <p>Approximately 75% of all Presidential disaster declarations are associated with flooding.</p>
